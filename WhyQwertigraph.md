Because you are lazy all the best ways. 

If you type 500 words per day at 30 Words Per Minute, using the Qwertigraph your fingers will only work as if you had typed 300 and you will finish in 10 minutes instead of 16. In a year you'll have saved a whole day's worth of typing and avoided carpal tunnel syndrome to boot. 

Qwertigraphy is too easy not to try, and it's built on the tried and true foundations of Gregg Shorthand and AutoHotkey. This is not some new, big-hyped vaporware. The tech behind this tech has been making hard-working people real money since 1916 -- more than 100 years. I've been using it two years now, and the real-world benefits stack up. I chat faster, email faster, and log off sooner every day. 

So, what is "it"?

Qwertigraphy gives you the Qwertigraph, the Dashboard, the Coach, and the Editor:

#### The Qwertigraph: 
Qwertigraphy's main engine holds a dictionary of ~40,000 abbreviations of frequently typed words and phrases. These abbreviations are called "qwerds". The more frequently the word is typed, the shorter its qwerd. The Qwertigraph watches every keystroke you make, and when it detects you have typed a qwerd, it immediately deletes your qwerd and replaces it with the longer word the qwerd represents. It can do this with an input speed of 360 WPM and produce output at 600 WPM. Don't worry, it can keep up with you. 

> U rio hs nt u se ha, jus afa u k g 

...becomes...

> You write this and you see that, just as fast as you can go

Some of the qwerds you will type to make a word seem non-sensical. Like, "rio" for "write" in the example above. The quick explanation for that particular example is that the word "right" is already taking "ri", so the letter "o" is appended to the "ri" to make the difference. The Dashboard will help you remember the less intuitive qwerds, the Coach will help you learn them, and the Editor will let you create qwerds you can remember and use. 

### The Dashboard: 
The Dashboard is always available to tell you how you're doing and what you're about to do. You can hide or unhide it at any time by hitting Win-Alt-D. The Dashboard tells you:
- At the far left, your speed after transformations compared to your input speed
- At the far right, the qwerd pending right now
-- At the top, the word your qwerd will produce 
-- Next down, the letter form of that qwerd in Gregg
-- Below that, the way you would right that qwerd in Pen Gregg
-- Last, the qwerd itself
- Between the speed and current qwerd is a history of the last several qwerds you've typed 
- At the very bottom is a predictive text section
-- This section tells what word will be produced if you type any of the following letters
-- o,i,u,t,d,a,e,r,n,g,s

The Dashboard will not tell you everything, but it gives you something to reference if you think you remember a given qwerd and want to be sure.

#### The Coach: 
You only need to know a handful of qwerds to begin saving time and effort, but knowing that first form is a stretch. The Coach is there to help. The Coach marks down every word you type out manually, and gives you instant feedback on the qwerds to use instead. 

The way to start with the Qwertigraph is to type a normal text exactly as you usually would, then let the Coach review your work and tell you which words you should learn first to learn fastest. 

Start the Qwertigraph, type for a while, then open the Coach tab and click "Filter". Next, click the "Savings" tab within the Coach tab, and see the biggest negative number. That is the word to learn next. Learn 10 words a day that way, and in a month you will be saving a hundreds of keystrokes a day. 

#### The Editor: 
Do you type "Director of Enterprise Marketing" 75 times a day? Edit your dictionary, and turn that into "dym". Do you do quantum computing in your spare time? Add all your tech terms to your dictionary. 

Learning even a handful of words a day will change your typing life. Typing's not a big part of life, but if typing can be better and fun at the same time, why not?

#### But didn't I mention taking faster notes with a pen?

You will quickly learn the qwerd for the word, "and". In Qwertigraphy, that's typed "nt". It only saves one keystroke, but it does so 50 times a day for the rest of your life. Once you have "and" committed to automatic response memory, you can begin using it in your pen writing just as easily. In longhand, the word "and" requires 7 joined pen-strokes (if you're not too fancy.) Writing just "nt" instead takes your pen-load down to only 5 strokes. It's a gain. 

Gregg Shorthand reduces the "nt" of "and" to a single pen-stroke. That's 86% of your life back.

Once you've learned the Qwertigraphy representation of any word, you can take a quick look at the Dashboard learn to its Gregg shorthand representation. A hard-working longhand writer will usually take their notes at something like 25 words per minute. With Gregg, 100 WPM will be well within your reach, and the best shorthand users exceed 200 WPM. Learn Gregg, and writing will become so much fun you'll be tempted to start writing more valuable notes, notes filled with a ton more detail. 

*Qwertigraphy cannot be held responsible for such self-abuse, but it's a risk you'll have to take.*
