### Using the Qwertigraph

##### Tips
- The Qwertigraph will attempt to keep a history of what you've written 
    - This will allow you to backspace and modify existing text to expand as a new qwerd
    - This system may or may not seem intuitive at first, as it will work depending upon complex factors 
    - Things that erase history include: mouse clicks, some control key uses, and most navigation keys 
- The Backtick (`) symbol will cancel an expansion
    - Type the characters that would ordinarily expand, then type the end character like normal
- The Escape key (Esc) will immediately perform an expansion
    - Use this to CamelCase a word
    - Type the first qwerd, hit escape to expand that qwerd, then type the next qwerd and so on
    - The function of the escape key is NOT disabled, so only do this in interfaces that ignore Esc
- Control-Space will cancel an expansion
    - Type the characters that would ordinarily expand, then type control space and continue like normal 
- Control-Backspace is your friend
    - Control-Backspace has always been the combo to backspace an entire word at a time 
    - With standard QWERTY typing, you always know how many characters to backspace
    - With Qwertigraphy, a given qwerd can expand into a word of any length, so Control-Backspace will help
    - The cost, though, is that every "Control-Backspace" resets the history of what you have written
