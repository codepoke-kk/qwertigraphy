### Using the Qwertigraph

##### Tips
- The Qwertigraph will attempt to keep a history of what you've written 
    - This will allow you to backspace and modify existing text to expand as a new qwerd
    - This system may or may not seem intuitive at first, as it will work depending upon complex factors 
    - Things that erase history include: mouse clicks, some control key uses, and most navigation keys 
- The Backtick (`) symbol will cancel an expansion
    - Type the characters that would ordinarily expand, then type the end character like normal
- The Escape key (Esc) will immediately perform an expansion
    - Use this to CamelCase a word
    - Type the first qwerd, hit escape to expand that qwerd, then type the next qwerd and so on
    - The function of the escape key is NOT disabled, so only do this in interfaces that ignore Esc
- Control-Space will cancel an expansion
    - Type the characters that would ordinarily expand, then type control space and continue like normal 
- Control-Backspace is your friend
    - Control-Backspace has always been the combo to backspace an entire word at a time 
    - With standard QWERTY typing, you always know how many characters to backspace
    - With Qwertigraphy, a given qwerd can expand into a word of any length, so Control-Backspace will help
    - The cost, though, is that every "Control-Backspace" resets the history of what you have written 
    
    
##### To do
There are still a lot of things you cannot do with the Qwertigraph, that I would like to make it do someday. 
- Persist settings across sessions 
- Page back through the Pen Gregg Pad to see everything written 
- Add ctrl-enter, tab, period, comma, and a few others 
- Clean up auto-spacing behavior 
- Clearly document how to use features (I'm still not doing this yet, because they are changing too quickly -- sorry)
- Clearly document how to throw away my dictionary and use your own 
- Make disabling chording a Setting 
- Reset bug in which I lose the buffer somehow when backspacing past the beginning of a given entry field
